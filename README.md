# Assignment: JavaScript Web APIs - Code Quiz

As I progress on my path to becoming a full-stack web developer, it's highly likely that I'll encounter coding assessments, often as part of various interview processes. These assessments typically encompass both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

To aid in my familiarization with such assessments and application of the skills covered in this module, I'm presented with the Challenge of constructing a timed coding quiz featuring multiple-choice questions. This web application will operate within a browser environment and will boast dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered by JavaScript code that I'll craft. The ultimate aim is to deliver a user interface that's sleek, refined, and responsive.

This week's coursework promises to arm me with all the necessary skills to excel in tackling this assignment.
